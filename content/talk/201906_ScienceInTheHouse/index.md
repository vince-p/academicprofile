abstract = "What do psychedelics have to do with mental health? From depression to anxiety, and trauma to addiction, research is increasingly showing us that psychedelic drugs may be highly effective in treating these conditions which are all too common in our modern world. Join us for a fascinating discussion about the medical science behind psychedelics at our inaugural Science in the House in the NSW Parliament. Cate Faehrmann MP will host a conversation with the President of Melbourneâ€™s Psychedelic Research into Science and Medicine (PRISM), Martin Williams, who is leading groundbreaking research into psilocybin, the psychoactive compound from magic mushrooms, and Vince Polito, who recently published the first longitudinal study on the effects of microdosing psychedelics and is currently investigating cognitive and neurological changes in altered states of consciousness. Parliament will have never heard anything like it!"
