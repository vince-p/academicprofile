## **We are seeking participants in the Sydney area for a clinical trial investigating ‘microdosing’ for the treatment of moderate depression at Macquarie University.**

<br />
<br />
### **{{< span style="color:Water;" text="What is involved?" >}}**  
Participants will undergo comprehensive psychiatric screening, and, if eligible, will take part in a 10-week intervention with 6 weeks of drug treatment (two microdoses each week).   
<br />
<br />
### **{{< span style="color:#16E2F5;" text="What are the risks?" >}}**  
Risks are minimal – there are no associations with dependence, overdose or long-term harm.   
The low doses used in this study are not expected to lead to marked changes in conscious awareness.
