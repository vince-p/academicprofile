### **We are seeking participants in the Sydney area for a clinical trial investigating ‘microdosing’ for the treatment of moderate depression at Macquarie University.**

<br />
<br />
**What is involved?**  
Participants will undergo comprehensive psychiatric screening, and, if eligible, will take part in a 10-week intervention with 6 weeks of drug treatment (two microdoses each week).   
<br />
<br />
**What are the risks?**  
Risks are minimal – there are no associations with dependence, overdose or long-term harm.
