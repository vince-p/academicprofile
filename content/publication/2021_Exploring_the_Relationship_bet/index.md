The results of research to date have been mixed. Whereas most studies have reported positive impacts of microdosing, some microdosers have also reported adverse effects. In addition, research to date has revealed inconsistent patterns of change in personality traits. This prospective study explored the relationship between microdosing, personality change, and emotional awareness.$<$/p$><$/div$><$div id='' class='section'$><$h3 class='abstractTitle text-title my-1' id='d5e8'$>$Methods$<$/h3$><$p$>$Measures of personality and alexithymia were collected at two time points. 76 microdosers participated at baseline. Invitations to a follow-up survey were sent out after 31 days, and 24 participants were retained.$<$/p$><$/div$><$div id='' class='section'$><$h3 class='abstractTitle text-title my-1' id='d5e11'$>$Results$<$/h3$><$p$>$Conscientiousness increased, while neuroticism decreased across these time points ($<$em$>$n =$<$/em$>$ 24). At baseline ($<$em$>$N$<$/em$>$ = 76), neuroticism was associated with alexithymia. In addition, neuroticism correlated negatively with duration of prior microdosing experience, and extraversion correlated positively with both duration of prior microdosing experience and lifetime number of microdoses.$<$/p$><$/div$><$div id='' class='section'$><$h3 class='abstractTitle text-title my-1' id='d5e21'$>$Conclusion$<$/h3$><$p$>$These results suggest that microdosing might have an impact on otherwise stable personality traits.$<$/p$><$/div$><$/section$>$"
