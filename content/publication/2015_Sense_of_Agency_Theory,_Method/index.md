abstract = "Sense of agency is an area of growing research interest with important implications for our understanding of consciousness; motor control; psychiatric symptoms, such as passivity phenomena; hypnosis; and the neuropsychological basis of moral and legal responsibility. These seemingly disparate research topics all overlap in a push toward increasingly specific models of the subjective phenomenology of action. In December 2013, a group of cognitive scientists, philosophers, and clinicians working on sense of agency gathered for a workshop at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. The collection of articles in this special issue presents a selection of ideas that have developed from that meeting and demonstrates some of the latest thinking on the theory, methods, and application of agency research."
