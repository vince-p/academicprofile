abstract = "The phenomenon of hypnosis links to other aspects of both psychological science and the professional practice of psychology. We reflect on selected themes related to hypnosis and associated phenomena, both scientific and clinical. In doing so, we make special reference to the work of Steven Jay Lynn, a consummate scientist-practitioner, whose work and influence reflected and contributed to the rhythm and reach of hypnosis and associated phenomena over the late 20th and early 21st century.
