abstract = "Chanting is a universal practice with deep ethnocultural roots. More recently, chanting has become popular on online platforms and meditation apps which have extended chanting practices beyond their original cultural, sacred, and healing traditions. The aim of the current study was to determine if online chanting meditation promotes altered states of consciousness and psychosocial benefits when compared to a narrative listening control and whether there are different effects of online chanting for experienced and novice meditators. Experienced and novice chanters completed a 10-minute online chanting or listening activity prior to measures of ego dissolution, mystical states, mindfulness, social connection and anxiety. Differences between chanting conditions (chanting vs. listening) and experience (experienced vs. novice meditators) were examined using 2,texttimes,2 ANOVAs and ANCOVAs, controlling for spirituality. Results showed ego dissolution and mystical state scores were higher in the chanting compared to the listening condition for experienced chanters, but not for novices. Spirituality was also a significant covariate for ego dissolution, mystical experience and mindfulness, suggesting these states of consciousness were partially dependent on spiritual or religious beliefs. This research shows that an online chanting intervention can lead to marked altered states of consciousness for individuals with prior experience with chanting. The findings may inform future design and development of contemplative activities."
