In this line of research we are exploring how alterations in consciousness can help us develop more complete models of cognitive functioning.

* **Our research with hypnosis has demonstrated how suggestion and belief can lead to profound changes in action, and automatic behaviours.**
* **Meditation research research is showing state and trait changes in low level attentional capacities that can result simple mindfulness practices.**
* **Investigation of states of flow have highlighted how expertise and training can lead to changes in the sense of agency associated with complex tasks.**
* **We are using virtual reality to explore the multisensory cues that lead to feelings of immersion and presence in virtual worlds.**
