To make sense of the world our brains and minds are constantly monitoring events that we cause in the environment and tracking the location of our body in space. These aspects of self awareness are crucial for succesful goal directed actions, complex behaviours and social interactions. In this line of research we are developing new measures of self representation and behavioural tools for quantifying changes in these senses.
